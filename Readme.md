# Energy Requirement Prediction using Azure Machine Learning

## 1. Description
In this project, we aim to solve an energy prediction use case. The goal is to determine whether there is an **energy requirement** ("Yes" or "No") based on various environmental and usage factors such as temperature, humidity, energy usage patterns, and more. This use case is essential for optimizing energy management, resource allocation, and cost savings in energy-intensive industries.

## 2. Objective
The primary objective of this project is to leverage Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) for end-to-end machine learning workflows, including:
1. **Create Data**: Generate synthetic data to simulate energy requirements.
2. **Train Models**: Experiment with multiple machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).
3. **Register Models**: Save the best-performing models to Azure ML's Model Registry for versioning and reuse.
4. **Create Endpoints**: Deploy models to real-time and batch endpoints for predictions.
5. **Create Deployments**: Implement scalable deployment strategies for inference.
6. **Create Batch Run Job**: Process large datasets using batch endpoints for predictions.

## 3. Dataset Description
The dataset is synthetic and contains the following features:
- **Temperature (Â°C)**: Ambient temperature.
- **Humidity (%)**: Humidity level in percentage.
- **Energy Usage (kWh)**: Current energy consumption in kilowatt-hours.
- **Peak Hours (hours)**: Hours during peak energy usage.
- **Cost of Energy ($)**: Cost of energy per unit.
- **Weather Index**: A composite score reflecting weather conditions.
- **Appliance Load (%)**: Percentage of load capacity used by household appliances.
- **Solar Output (kWh)**: Amount of solar energy generated.
- **Wind Output (kWh)**: Amount of wind energy generated.
- **Seasonality Index**: Seasonal variations affecting energy requirements.

The target variable is:
- **Energy Requirement**: A binary classification ("Yes" or "No") indicating whether additional energy is needed.

## 4. Modeling Architecture
We employed the following modeling architecture:
1. **Algorithms**:
   - **Random Forest Classifier**: For robust predictions with decision trees in an ensemble.
   - **Logistic Regression**: For linear modeling of energy requirements.

   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: For high-dimensional decision boundaries.

2. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score

3. **Experiment Tracking**:
   - All experiments are tracked in **MLflow**.
   - Parameters, metrics, and model artifacts are logged.

4. **Model Management**:
   - Best models are registered in Azure ML's Model Registry for version control and deployment.
